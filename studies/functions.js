        //~~~~~What are Functions~~~~~\\




        //~~~~~How Functions Execute~~~~~\\
        ////////    First we must ___? Next we can execute 
        ///////     (or two other words for executing a
        ///////     function?) a function by?


        //~~~~~Parameters vs Passed Arguments~~~~~\\
        /////   What’s the difference between a function’s parameters and 
        /////   arguments PASSED to a function?
        
        
        
        //~~~~~Named Functions~~~~~\\
        /////    What’s the syntax for a NAMED function?
        
        
        //~~~~~Assigning Functions to a Variable~~~~~\\
        /////    How do we assign a function to a variable?
        
        
        
        
        
        //~~~~~Specify Input/Output Functions~~~~~\\
        ////    Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and
        ////    OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do 
        ////    we specify inputs, and how do we specify outputs?
        
        
        //~~~~~Scope~~~~~\\
        ////    Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in 
        ////    parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true.



        //~~~~~Closure~~~~~\\
        ////    Closures: Functions form closures around the data 
        ////    they house. If an object returned from the 
        ////    Function and is held in memory somewhere (referenced), 
        ////    that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist 
        ////    in these closures! (See: our meeting-room app for an 
        ////    example!) (ALSO, see: Understanding JavaScript 
        ////    Closures with Ease)
